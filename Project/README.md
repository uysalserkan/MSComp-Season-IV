# CMP722 - Advanced Computer Vision Project

## Project Overview

This project is a computer vision application that uses advanced computer vision techniques to solve a real-world problem.

Selected Dataset: [STL-10](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)
Selected Architecture: ViT


## Dataset

STL-10 is a dataset for developing unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, and self-taught learning algorithms. It contains:
- Training set: 5,000 labeled images (10 classes, 500 per class)
- Test set: 8,000 labeled images (10 classes, 800 per class)
- Unlabeled set: 100,000 unlabeled images
- Image size: 96x96 pixels
